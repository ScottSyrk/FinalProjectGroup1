        <li>Oranges for ingredient and for garnish</li>
        <li>Cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>Mulling spices of your choice (Our mix includes star anise, dried raisins and apples, nutmeg, cloves)</li>

    <p>To make this new take on mulled wine, you can use a splash of rose water for an aromatic addition to your mulled wine. Mix all the ingredients in a pot and over medium heat, heat until the wine reaches a simmer. Take care not to overheat the wine as alcohol vaporizes if heated for too long. Reduce heat to low and let it simmer 15-30 min. If you like your mulled wine without any spice particles, strain the mixture at the end and pour the drink in a mug of choice If you used rose tea bags for the aroma, remove the bags before straining. </p>
