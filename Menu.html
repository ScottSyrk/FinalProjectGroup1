    <p>Mulled wine originated in the 2nd century. It was created by the Romans who would heat wine to defend their bodies against the cold winter. As the Romans conquered much of Europe throughout the next century, their love for mulled wine spread across their empire and the regions they traded with.</p>

            <div class="text">

<p>The Old Fashion has a long history. The original name of this cocktail was "Whiskey Cocktail". The Old Fashion is a sophisticated blend of bourbon, bitters, soda and sugar that dates back to the 1800's! The name comes from the way the cocktail is made with people heading to cocktail bars and requesting for their drink to be created in the 'old fashioned way'. The simplicity of the drink and how much the spirit shines are two reasons the Old Fashion has been able to sustain it's popularity through time.</p>

    <p>The term "julep" is generally defined as a sweet drink, particularly one used as a vehicle for medicine. It is difficult to think of another cocktail that's as intimately tied to a particular event as the Mint Julep is to the Kentucky Derby. Interestingly enough, however, it's origins aren't in Kentucky at all, but rather, linguistically at least, in the middle East. The Mint Julip became the official drink of the Kentucky Derby during the 1930's, when Churchill Downs started serving it in souvenir julep cups.

        <div class="text">

<p>The Champagne Cocktail is used as a way to add a bit of extra presentation to champagne for toasting. The bitters provide a nice earthy and herbal element to the cocktail, but the sugar cube doesn't add much sweetness. The most significant contribution of the sugar cube is to give the carbonation in the champagne a surface to atomize onto and make the drink and overwhelming display of carbonation. If you're looking for a simple way to elevate your presentation during a toast, the Champagne Cocktail is a fun one to try.</p>

    <p>Tequila Sunrise, just like the Eagles song is a smooth classic. You can't go wrong with this cocktail originating from Phoenix in the 1930's with an added California twist in the 1970's to give the appearance of a sunrise through it's gradations of color. A great drink to bring out the sunshine in you!!</p>
