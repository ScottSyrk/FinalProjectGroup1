    <p> Measure out ice cream and let melt a bit, if you find that your ice cream is quite hard. Some freezers really freeze ice cream and it can be very hard and difficult to blend into the drink to get it nice and frothy. If your freezer doesnâ€™t tend to freeze ice cream solid, you should be able to just pop the ice cream into the glass and go. You want the ice cream to be a bit firmer than soft serve. In warmer climates, this may only take a couple minutes for the ice cream to soften a bit. Mix water and orange juice in a jug. Add in ice cream and mix well. The mixture will be come a bit frothy.</p>
